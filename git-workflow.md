# Clone Repo

```
git clone <repository-on-git-hub>
```

# Commit 
```
git add <file-name>
```
If you want to commit all changes once, just type

```
git add .
```

Then add a message to others understand your changes

```
git commit -m "add this new feature"
```

But your code doesn't live on Github yet. In order to do this, you need to 'push' to Github

```
git push
```

# Branching

```
git branch -b <new-branch-name>
```

`-b` means we're creating a new branch
